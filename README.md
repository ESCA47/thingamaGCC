# thingamaGCC
Branch of PhobGCC with changes that I(esca) wanted for QOL stuff

List of changes:

-Flipped Teensy

-Flipped stickbox

-Ground Plane instead of 3.3v plane on top

-Better trigger positioning for JSTs

-JST for Z button

-Cstick uses smd pads instead of throughhole as well as jst compatible

-Fixed Z switch(multiple things to get them nicer to work with) 

-Removed unpopulated components

-Easy 5v, 3.3v, and ground points

-Extended pads on pots and halls

-Smaller holes on the cable to fit more like oem


All of these changes are just qol stuff that I absolutely wanted so its just minimal things that add up.
